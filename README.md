server = Plux.worker(:abc, thread: 2) do

  # prepare thread-safe resources like mq/db, to handle requests
  def initialize
    # @db = ...
  end

  # threads call this method to deal with clients' message
  def work(msg)
    # @db << parse(msg)
  end
end

# clients connect, send msg, and close concurrently
5.times do |n|
  Thread.new do
