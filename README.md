An easy unixsocket server

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```

And then execute:

Or install it yourself as:

## Usage

```ruby
# start one and only process named 'abc',
# no matter the code below is called how many times in whatever processes/threads
server = Plux.worker(:abc) do

  # prepare resources like mq/db, to handle requests
  def initialize
    # @db = ...
  end

  # threads call this method to deal with clients' message
  def work(msg)
    # @db << parse(msg)
  end
end

# five threads will be started to handle these clients,
# and finished once their counterparts call close
5.times do |n|
  Thread.new do
    client = server.connect
    client.puts "hello #{n}"
    client.close
  end
end
```
